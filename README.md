#DBC::NYC Whiteboarding Wednesdays

##DBC White Board Wednesdays

In order to prepare for technical interviews, DBC student’s have started a white boarding group on Wednesday nights at DBC’s school in New York. I have the opportunity to host next week’s white boarding session. The purpose of this document is to provide some structure.

**Theme for the session (ex: Hash Tables)** 

**Prep-work:** 
  - Define (in your words using the Feynman technique) any relative terms
	- ex: What is a Hash Table? break it down into terms that you understand

**WHY WE DO THIS:**

One of the biggest roadblocks to learning is often vocabulary. Our brains work best by making associations to things we already know, so it is an essential skill to be able to break down new concepts into things you are already familiar with and can relate to. The purpose of this exercise is to practice breaking down abstract concepts into ways that make sense to you.

- 2-3 problems based on the theme
		- studnets are expected to solve these problems and come to the session prepared

**WHY WE DO THIS:**

It is easier to have a group conversation when everyone is on the same page. The goal with the prep work problems is so that when we meet on Wednesdays, students will already be familiar with the problems and solution patterns.

**Whiteboarding Session:**

	2-3 students go to whiteboard and put their definitions up on the board (5 mins)
	each student then has to “teach” the class the term they defined (provide example maybe?)

**WHY WE DO THIS**

Practice explaining your thought process and speaking in front of a whiteboard.


	- Students are divided into 2-3 groups and assigned one of the prep-work problems

	  - each student solves the problem (without being able to reference their notes from the prep-work) and 1 student 	from each group is randomly chosen to solve it on the board (using Greg’s technique)

**WHY WE DO THIS**

Repetition is crucial to learning. By having the students solve the problems in advance, they are already familiarizing themselves with the patterns needed for the solution, and practicing Greg’s system. 

	— if student at board did not prepare a solution before hand or is not able to solve the problem, he may get help 	from his group, however, no one else in his group is allowed to write on the whiteboard. They will have to 	articulate both what to do and why to do it to their team mate using Greg’s system.

**WHY WE DO THIS**

If the person randomly chosen to whiteboard does not know how to solve the problem, they are still required to think through and solve it with the help of their group. They need to know why they are doing each step so that they can explain it to the entire class. 

	— each person at the whiteboard walks through their solution using Greg’s system:
		1. Function Signatures
		2. Examples
		3. Assumptions
		4. Algorithms
		5. Code!
		6. Checking Back, relaxing assumptions

**WHY WE DO THIS**

There are millions of different questions that you could be asked for any given interview so it is not feasible to try and prepare for every possible question you may be asked. This makes developing a system to solve technical questions essential. By going through the same process each time, regardless of the questions, you are less likely to get “stuck” and are more likely to recognize patterns in the solutions. We are going to rely on Greg’s experience at Google and expertise in this area to be the baseline for our system, but each student should modify it in a way that makes most sense to them.


	— after each presentation, we discuss the solution and open the floor to alternative solutions and why that solution is better

**WHY WE DO THIS**

Hopefully students have found a few different solutions to each problem and we can discuss assumptions, and tradeoffs from multiple solutions.
